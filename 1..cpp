/*
A train can travel 50% faster than a car. Both start from point A at the same time and reach point B, 75 kms away from A at the same time.
 On the way, however, the train lost about 12.5 minutes while stopping at the stations.Write a C program to compute the speed of car.
*/
/*
Step 1- Start
Step 2-Declare distance, time, speed
Step 3- Read distance and time
Step 4- Calculate the speed by (60.0*distance)/(3*time)
Step 5- Print value of speed
Step 6- Stop
