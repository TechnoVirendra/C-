Practical 2.1: Ram, Mohan and Sohan took loan of Rs. x, y and z on rate of interest r%, p%, q% for time t1, t2 and t3 years respectively. Calculate simple interest they will pay and find who will pay the most using ternary operator?

Solution:*/

#include<stdio.h>

int main()

{

     int x,y,z;

  float p,q,r;

  float t1,t2,t3;

  float s1,s2,s3;

  printf("Enter Ram's amount of loan rate and time \n");

  scanf("%d%f%f",&x,&p,&t1);



  printf("Enter Mohan's amount of loan rate and time \n");

  scanf("%d%f%f",&y,&q,&t2);

  printf("Enter Sohan's amount of loan rate and time \n");

  scanf("%d%f%f",&z,&r,&t3);

  s1=(p*x*t1)/100;

  s2=(q*y*t2)/100;

  s3=(r*z*t3)/100;

  printf("Ram pay interest=%f\n",s1);

  printf("Mohan pay interest=%f\n",s2);

  printf("Sohan pay interest=%f\n",s3);

  printf("Maximum interest paid by :");

  s1>s2?(s1>s3?printf("Ram"):printf("Sohan")):(s2>s3?printf("Mohan"):printf("Sohan"));



   return 0;
