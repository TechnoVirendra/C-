/*Practical 3.4: While travelling in a train, you observe some college students pulling the alarm chain simply to get down at their desired point.
Out of n students m<=n times students pull the chain .You have to print according to the following:

1)    If m is >=80 % of n then print strict action is required to restrict this event

2)    If m is between 50 to 80 % then print guidelines should be issued

3)    If between 10 to 50% then print request to restrict the event

4)    If less than 10% then print No action required  */
